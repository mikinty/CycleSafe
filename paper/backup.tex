% About our testing methods

Data collection to inform these alerts will be done using an array of sensors mounted on the bicycle as well as location data via a Maps API. To evaluate the effectiveness of the jacket under dangerous circumstances, we will conduct a simulation test in a closed test track. We are aiming to have $<$5\% false negatives, and $<$20\% false positives in 60 trial runs. We want to have a lower false negative than false positive because missing a dangerous condition is much worse than alerting the user where there are no dangers. More details about our testing can be found in \ref{specs:warning_thresholds}.
